# ChatBot

Hello to you..

In this repository, 

I Learend how to creat the IBM Watson ChatBot. So you can see the files above the json file and the chatbot code added to the index.html.

I used the embed code to add it to the main page (index.html) of the control. 
As it is my firt time using the chatbot I tried to make reservation chat bot so I used the entities which makes it easier to the chatbot to identify new phrasing for my intents and added some examples of what the user might say. Also,I used the system entities which makes the chatbot recognize references to things like numbers and dates in user input and how to make it web chat and how to style and make a good first impression for the user.

The pictures for my Chatbot..
